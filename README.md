# Fbw A320 Takeoff Calculator
 
 
I recommend SmartSim. Any other calculator (including the one mentioned here) is horribly wrong. The one from the OP e.g. Almost always commands TOGA thrust, which is rarely the case in normal conditions in real life. Most other calculators are based on the CEO and are therefore just as wrong (the NEO e.g. has 2 Tons more maximum takeoff weight because of the stronger engines).

SimSmart (or SmartSim? Im confused sorry) is very close to the real life perf calc. I can recommend it, it always worked fine for me.
 
I have just flown the development version of the FBW A320 out of KSAN and used both this Performance Calculator alongside the SimSmart payware performance calculator. Entering the same data, the calculated results are significantly different.

All input fields must be filled before the "Calculate" button becomes available. There are two ways in which certain input fields can be automatically filled. If SimBrief data has been loaded into the EFB, airport and runway information (including runway bearing, TORA, runway elevation, and runway slope), as well as environmental data (wind, temperature, and QNH), can be automatically filled in by selecting "OFP" in the upper right drop-down selection box and clicking on the **Fill data from**.
 
This will load the environment data used by your SimBrief flight plan. You can either change/update the environment data or load it from scratch automatically without havingloaded it from the OFP by ensuring the Airport input field in the calculator is filled, then selecting "METAR" in the upper right drop-down selection box and clicking on **Filldata from**.
 
The wind can be input simply as the headwind component (a single positive number) or tailwind component (a single negative number), or it can be input in the form degrees/kts. It can be automatically entered from either the OFP or the METAR as described above. If you enter the wind yourself, be sure you are entering the wind in terms of a magnetic direction rather than the true direction. ATIS winds will be provided in terms of a magnetic direction, but METAR winds are in terms of true direction. If you enter the winds from METAR, consult the airport 10-9 (or 10-9A) chart to determine the magnetic variation and convert the direction to magnetic, as shown in the following examples in Advanced Takeoff Calculator Guide. If you choose to enter the winds automatically from the METAR, this conversion will be done automatically.
 
If the wind direction is given as variable, enter the wind direction into the takeoff performance calculator as a tailwind. If the wind direction varies between 2 values, enter the wind direction that will result in the largest tailwind (if the direction includes a tailwind direction) or the smallest headwind. If the wind speed includes a gust value, enter only the steady wind value.
 
This calculator helps the pilot to calculate when to start descending (aka the Top of Descent) based on various variables so that different scenarios can be calculated (e.g., descending with 3 descent rate, descending with a given vertical speed, etc.).

To calculate the TOD with a fixed angle of descent, we simply have to enter the starting altitude and the desired target altitude.We can also enter a certain angle besides 3. But 3 is a common standard descent angle in aviation and rarely needs to be changed.
 
The primary purpose of this calculator is to aid the flight crew in assessing whether a landing can be safely made within the given runway length in existing conditions. The pilot can also use this tool to determine the appropriate level of braking and whether reverse thrust is needed to stop within the available runway distance.
 
The calculator results are shown both numerically and graphically. Variations in airplane configuration, approach speed, runway surface condition, and other parameters can also be investigated to see their effect on the airplane's landing distance. The landing distance results include a safety margin of 15 % added to the calculated distance.
 
Enter the required data into the calculator fields. The initial state of the calculator will have all input fields blank except for runway condition (Dry), flap setting (Full), overweight procedure (No), and reverse thrust (No). It is important to note that all fields must be filled to activate the "Calculate" button. The "Clear" button will return input fields to the initial state.
 
This runway's landing distance available is long enough to be used for landing with full flaps only and with max manual braking.Be aware that there might be other restrictions that prohibit landing of an A320neo on this airport/runway.
 
having a thrust performance problem with A320/A321 pro IAE engines only. the cfm work well. this has happened with 5 flights in row IAE only. takeoff performance at different airports over the last week KSAN, KPHX, KLAX, KLAS and now KSFO today at 1pm KSFO to KSAN. it had a F79 suggested takeoff performance calculation based off perfromance calculator.
 
The plane was off the end of runway almost in water and barely lifted off. i had to pull back at 137kts or else i end up in the drink. the plane was barely climbing and when i hit 800' than speed declined and stall warning occurs. had to manual toga and get up.
 
So maybe I spoke too soon . Just took off 3 min ago from KSAN. Same problem . What is goin on here with the IAE models ? This time I took off from Ksan and used different perf calculator. Used the Wabpro online .
 
I also use airplane toolbox. It is DEAD wrong with IAE flex trust me. The other day it gave me for a MTOW A321 Flex of 69 on KBOS's 33L... I knew the airplane would overrun the runway. I wish it would be fixed!
 
Can the takeoff performance calculator in Simbrief calculate data for all engine types on a given aircraft? ie would I be able to calculate data for an IAE powered A320, when specified in the airframe profile?
 
A further detail that matters a lot less, but would I be able to calculate with different thrust ratings on that engine? For instance, the 737-900 engines can be rated up to 27000 lbf of thrust, but many operators keep them rated at 26k, and the Levelup 737-900 only simulates CFM engines with 26000 lbf of thrust.
